# **Why** you chose this ending for the interactive story

- Definitely was NOT tricked to end always in the same ending
- Definitely do NOT try every single alternative scenario to see if its true
- I think there is something like 1 ending(s)

---
# **Where** this ending will lead you
Ending? Jaja. No.

You are not finished.

Oh no.

You have a bunch of other places to go after you are finished with this RStudio presentation. Take it as a sort of Easter Egg hunt, but as a Birthday Egg Hunt (?) idk.

See how far the rabbit hole goes...
